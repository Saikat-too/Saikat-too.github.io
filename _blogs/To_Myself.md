# Introduction

People's talk or note that inspired me  . I will leave them here so when  I  feel gloomy or demotivated , I will come back here and understand why I start it in first place .


#  Brian Enos


When I began shooting I had only basic ideas about techniques , so I did what I felt was the logical thing. I found the best local shooter and asked him how I should shoot . He told me without hesitation. Left index finger on the trigger guard , left elbow bent and pulling back etcetra , etcetra . I adopted the system blindly for a year or two before wandering whether there might be a system that better suited my structure and attitude . This first style that I adopted didn't seem to fit me because it felt as though I was having to struggle to control the gun . I was never actually following the gun as I feel I do now . My experiment led me to pull ideas from all types Shooting styles: Soceles , Modified Weaver , Bullseye and from people such as Bill Bluenkenship , Shotguner , John Satterwhite and marital artist Bruce Lee. But ideas coming from your environment only steer you in the right direction . These ideas can limit their thinking by their very nature....great ideas will arise from a feeling within yourself . The intuitive awareness will allow you to accept anything that works for you and discard anything that doesn't.


# Stephen King

Top tips of Stephen King that I feel useful and can be mapped with other life scenerios not only with writing .

1. Stop watching television , it is poisonous for creativity . Writer should look into himself . Writer should do two things the most , one is Read a lot and another is Write a lot . Constantly redefined your works again and again .


2. Prepare for more failure and criticism . If you write , sing , dance , paint there will be someone who will make you feel lousy about it .You have to continue writting even if you don't want to . When you fail , remain positive .

3. Don't wast time pleasing people . Rudeness is the least of your problems . Every decent writer is accused of being a waste of talent . If anybody disapprove any of my work , I can't do anything about it . It is what I have . Write for yourself , for you happiness . Do it for the joy of doing it , then the creativity will appear from inside .

4. Most difficult first . Most important topic/story is the hardest one to write . You can feel ashamed thinking how will I decribe such a great topic or story in words . But do it with great passion , love and time . Take your time to craft it into a beautiful piece of art .
